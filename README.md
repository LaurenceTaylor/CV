I am a full stack developer and former fraud analyst, having recently completed the software development programme at [Makers](https://makers.tech/). The course emphasised TDD and Agile methodologies, as well as code quality and best practices. I am keen to work in (almost) any language, and always strive to pick things up quickly, help my team succeed, and deepen my understanding. It would be fantastic to continue learning within a high performing and communicative team.

I've had an interest in coding for several years. At university I elected to take a module on vegetation modelling in R, and I found it among the most enjoyable of my degree. For a while I continued learning through the usual routes: freeCodeCamp, The Odin Project, Codecademy, edX, Codewars and others. In my previous role I approached management and secured approval to learn SQL, enabling far better analysis of global fraud trends. It was only SQL, but this was a thrill!

A few months ago I fully pursued my interest in development, applying and being selected for Makers. I am now excited to embark on a career which enables lifelong learning, working on interesting projects, and contributing to forward-thinking organisations.

## Projects

Project | Description | Technologies | Testing/ Other
--- | --- | --- | ---
[Deep Root](https://github.com/LaurenceTaylor/deep_root) | Final project, working in an agile team for the last week and a half of the course: a self-contained plant monitoring station with touch-screen interface. A single-page desktop app where users can start and stop monitoring, be notified of optimal moisture levels, and view historical data with no interruption in readings | Raspberry Pi, Adafruit STEMMA, 3.5-inch touch screen; Python, JavaScript, SQLite, Eel, Plotly, HTML/ CSS | Pytest, ESLint, Pylama, Travis CI
[Personal Site](https://github.com/LaurenceTaylor/personal-site) | Independently built a personal website using unfamiliar technology, and practiced styling a website from scratch | GatsbyJS, HTML/ CSS | ESLint, Surge
[Gilded Rose](https://github.com/LaurenceTaylor/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata) | A solution to the Gilded Rose refactoring kata | Ruby | RSpec, Rubocop
[Acebook Spacebook](https://github.com/LaurenceTaylor/acebook-spacebook) | Our introduction to agile methodologies and Ruby on Rails: a Facebook clone made in two weeks. Deployed on [Heroku](https://acebook-spacebook.herokuapp.com/) | Ruby on Rails, HTML/ CSS | RSpec, Capybara, Rubocop, Travis CI, Heroku
[Chitter](https://github.com/LaurenceTaylor/chitter-challenge) | A weekend project to build a Twitter clone | Ruby, Sinatra, Postgresql, HTML/ CSS | RSpec, Capybara, Rubocop
[Frontend API Challenge](https://github.com/LaurenceTaylor/frontend-api-challenge) | Another weekend project to build a Twitter clone, this time as a single-page app in JavaScript using a RESTful API | JavaScript, HTML/ CSS, jQuery | Surge. I created a rudimentary testing framework that week, which I used here!

## Skills

### Learning Quickly and Independently

One of Makers' mottos is 'learning how to learn', and they provide students with the tools and concepts to do so. In week 5 we were tasked with learning the basics of JavaScript within one week, then producing a [bowling scorecard app](https://github.com/LaurenceTaylor/bowling-challenge) on the weekend. This experience built my confidence, and for the [final project](https://github.com/LaurenceTaylor/deep_root) my team and I challenged ourselves to learn something completely new by creating a hardware product with a Python backend.

In my previous role I learned a suite of software (Cybersource, Sift Science, Arkowl and more) within weeks, as well as SQL and the entirely unfamiliar field that was fraud prevention. I became one of the top performers in terms of targets within a few months.

### Communication and Collaboration

At Makers students either pair every day or work on group projects. This requires continuous communication, collaboration, and code review. When we were learning about single-page apps and APIs in JavaScript my team and I managed to produce and deploy a simple [notes app](https://github.com/LaurenceTaylor/notes_js) within a few days. This was enabled by frequent knowledge sharing and mobbing, and it was really enjoyable to make breakthroughs in the project together. Working on larger group projects such as [Acebook Spacebook](https://github.com/LaurenceTaylor/acebook-spacebook) and [MakersBnB](https://github.com/LaurenceTaylor/MakersAirBnB-) would have been impossible without regular stand-ups/ retros, reviews and good git collaboration.

### Test-Driven Development

Every project completed at Makers was test driven using a variety of frameworks. I aspire to write isolated tests, which test behaviour and not state, while achieving high coverage. I believe TDD is critical to producing high quality and concise code while avoiding regression.

### Problem Solving and Debugging

A recent problem my team and I faced was to debug hardware - [our touch screen stopped working the moment we booted our app](https://medium.com/@makers_c_a_c_t_u_s/debugging-hardware-by-ben-82c38ada24bc), and no errors were thrown to guide our thinking. 'Closing the loop' was our saving grace, and we eliminated possible failures one by one until we found the exact issue.
