I am a full stack software developer, former fraud analyst, and recent QMUL graduate. I have just completed the software development programme at Makers which placed strong emphasis on processes/ methodologies such as TDD, OOP, agile, MVC, git collaboration, and CI/CD. During the course I used JavaScript, Ruby and Python, but am enthusiastic to learn new technologies.

A few months ago I fully pursued my interest in coding, applying and being selected for Makers (developing a slight [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/LaurenceTaylor) habit in the process). I am now excited to embark on a career which enables lifelong learning, working on interesting projects, and contributing to forward-thinking organisations.

Outside of coding I am interested in environmental issues, reading (book club member!), and playing guitar. I am also a keen, but untalented, 5-a-side football player.

## Projects

Project | Description | Technologies | Testing/ Other
--- | --- | --- | ---
[Deep Root](https://github.com/LaurenceTaylor/deep_root) | Final project, working in an agile team for the last week and a half of the course: a self-contained plant monitoring station with touch-screen interface. A single-page desktop app where users can start and stop monitoring, be notified of optimal moisture levels, and view historical data with no interruption in readings | Raspberry Pi, Adafruit STEMMA, 3.5-inch touch screen; Python, JavaScript, SQLite, Eel, Plotly, HTML/ CSS | Pytest, ESLint, Pylama, Travis CI
[Personal Site](https://github.com/LaurenceTaylor/personal-site) | Independently built a personal website using unfamiliar technology. Practiced styling a website from scratch. | GatsbyJS, HTML/ CSS | ESLint, Surge
[Gilded Rose](https://github.com/LaurenceTaylor/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata) | A solution to the Gilded Rose refactoring kata | Ruby | RSpec, Rubocop
[Acebook Spacebook](https://github.com/LaurenceTaylor/acebook-spacebook) | Our introduction to agile methodologies and Ruby on Rails: a Facebook clone made in two weeks. Deployed on [Heroku](https://acebook-spacebook.herokuapp.com/) | Ruby on Rails, HTML/ CSS | RSpec, Capybara, Rubocop, Travis CI, Heroku
[Chitter](https://github.com/LaurenceTaylor/chitter-challenge) | A weekend project to build a Twitter clone | Ruby, Sinatra, Postgresql, HTML/ CSS | RSpec, Capybara, Rubocop
[Frontend API Challenge](https://github.com/LaurenceTaylor/frontend-api-challenge) | Another weekend project to build a Twitter clone, this time as a single-page app in JavaScript using a RESTful API | JavaScript, HTML/ CSS, jQuery | I created a rudimentary testing framework that week, which I used here!

## Skills

### Learning Quickly and Independently

One of Makers' mottos is 'learning how to learn', and they provide students with the tools and concepts to do so. In week 5 we were tasked with learning the basics of JavaScript within one week, then producing a [bowling scorecard app](https://github.com/LaurenceTaylor/bowling-challenge) on the weekend. This experience built my confidence, and for the [final project](https://github.com/LaurenceTaylor/deep_root) my team and I challenged ourselves to learn something completely new by creating a hardware product.

In my previous role I learned a suite of software (Cybersource, Sift Science, Arkowl and more) within weeks, as well as SQL and the entirely unfamiliar field that was fraud prevention. I am pleased to say I became the top performer in terms of targets within three months.

### Communication and Collaboration

At Makers students either pair every day or work on group projects. This requires regular communication, collaboration, and code reviews. When we were learning about single-page apps and APIs in JavaScript my team and I managed to produce and deploy a simple [notes app](https://github.com/LaurenceTaylor/notes_js) within a few days. This was enabled by frequent knowledge sharing and mobbing, and it was really enjoyable to make breakthroughs in the project together. Working on larger group projects such as [Acebook Spacebook](https://github.com/LaurenceTaylor/acebook-spacebook) and [MakersBnB](https://github.com/LaurenceTaylor/MakersAirBnB-) would have been impossible without regular code reviews and good git collaboration.

### Test-Driven Development

Every project completed at Makers was test driven using a variety of frameworks. I aspire to write isolated tests, which test behaviour and not state, while achieving high coverage. I believe TDD is critical to producing high quality and concise code while avoiding regression.

### Problem Solving and Debugging

A recent problem my team and I faced was to debug hardware - [our touch screen stopped working the moment we booted our app](https://medium.com/@makers_c_a_c_t_u_s/debugging-hardware-by-ben-82c38ada24bc), and no errors were thrown to guide our thinking. 'Closing the loop' was our saving grace, and we eliminated possible failures one by one until we found the exact issue.
