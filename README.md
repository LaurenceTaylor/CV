# Laurence Taylor

I am a full stack software developer, former fraud analyst, and QMUL graduate. I recently completed the software development programme at Makers which placed strong emphasis on processes/ methodologies such as TDD, OOP, agile, MVC, git collaboration, and CI/CD. During the course I used JavaScript, Ruby and Python, but am enthusiastic to learn new technologies.

For the last few years I've known I liked to code. A few months ago I went all in, applying and being selected for Makers (developing a slight [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/LaurenceTaylor) habit in the process). I am now excited to embark on a career which enables lifelong learning, working on interesting projects, and contributing to forward-thinking organisations.

Outside of coding I am interested in environmental issues, reading (book club member!), and playing guitar. I am also a keen, but untalented, 5-a-side football player.

## Skills

### Learning Quickly and Independently

In my previous role I had to learn a range of software (Cybersource, Sift Science, Arkowl and more) within weeks, as well as the entirely alien field which was fraud prevention. I am pleased to say I became the top performer in terms of targets within a few months. Makers has added

### Attention to Detail



### Communication

Being on the Youth Panel of environmental charity Global Action Plan (GAP) afforded me a number of fantastic opportunities to develop my communication skills. I delivered a short speech in one of the keynote theatres of Edie Live 2018, the foremost sustainability conference in the UK. I also engaged in discussions with business leaders at EY in Canary Wharf, and spoke regularly with a team of peers while setting up a national campaign to reduce food packaging waste.
