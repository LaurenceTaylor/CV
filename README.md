## Laurence Taylor

Several years learning to code as a hobby (Codewars, Freecodecamp, The Odin Project) culminated in enrolling at Makers, a highly selective coding bootcamp in London, UK. Over the next three months I hope to engage with a comprehensive curriculum including test-driven development, agile development, and pair programming.

I recently graduated with a 2.1 from Queen Mary University of London, and worked as a Fraud Analyst for over a year within a major tech company. 

## Skills

#### Communication

Sitting on the Youth Advisory Panel of environmental charity Global Action Plan (GAP) provided me with several opportunities to develop my communication skills. I delivered a short speech in one of the keynote theatres of Edie Live, the foremost sustainability conference in the UK. I also engaged in a boardroom discussion with senior CSR professionals from a range of companies at EY in Canary Wharf.

#### Design

I have over 10 years of experience using Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, including work for clients. I designed the logo for GAP's "Long Live the Lunchbox" campaign which received extensive coverage online.
